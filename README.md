# Basic-naive-bayes-classification
Reads training text images which has digits in the form of patterns of '#' and ' '. Then classifies testing text images based on naive bayes classification

Every image is in the form of 28*28 grids, ' ' represent a white pixel, # represents a black background pixel and + represents a grey foreground pixel

Traininglabels has the resultant answers to the text images and similar is the pattern for testimages

Sample image:

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
             ++###+         
             ######+        
            +######+        
            ##+++##+        
           +#+  +##+

            +###+

          +##+              
         +##+
